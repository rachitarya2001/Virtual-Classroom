# Knowledge Land - Virtual Classroom Platform

## Introduction

**Knowledge Land** is a virtual classroom platform built using Full Stack Development technologies. It provides an online learning environment where instructors can manage classes, and students can access and engage with course materials. The platform supports discussions, enrollment management, and offers a structured learning experience.

## Features

1. **Class Management**
   - Instructors can create, update, and delete classes.
   - Each class can have multiple units and sessions.

2. **Course Material Access**
   - Sessions within a class can contain multiple lectures.
   - All users can access the course materials in the sessions.

3. **Discussion and Comments**
   - Users can add comments on lectures.
   - Comments can be nested to allow for threaded discussions.

4. **Enrollment**
   - Only students who are enrolled in a class can join and participate.

## Technical Approach

### 3.1. Frontend (React.js)

1. **Technology Stack**
   - **React.js:** For building the user interface.
   - **React Router:** For managing navigation and routing.
   - **Bootstrap:** For styling and responsive design.
   - **Axios:** For handling API requests.

2. **Components**
   - **Dashboard:** For instructors to manage classes and view analytics.
   - **Class List:** To view and select classes.
   - **Class Detail:** To manage and view units, sessions, and lectures.
   - **Lecture Detail:** To view lectures and add comments.
   - **Comment Section:** For nested discussions on lectures.

3. **State Management**
   - Use Reactâ€™s Context API or Redux for managing global state and user authentication.

4. **API Integration**
   - Use Axios to connect with backend APIs for CRUD operations related to classes, units, sessions, and lectures.

### 3.2. Backend (Node.js and Express.js)

1. **Technology Stack**
   - **Node.js:** For server-side logic.
   - **Express.js:** For building RESTful APIs.
   - **MongoDB:** For database management and storing class-related data.
   - **Redis (Optional):** For caching and session management.
   - **Nodemailer:** For sending email notifications.

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/classes`: Manage classes (create, read, update, delete).
   - `/api/units`: Manage units within classes.
   - `/api/sessions`: Manage sessions within units.
   - `/api/lectures`: Manage lectures within sessions.
   - `/api/comments`: Manage comments and nested replies on lectures.

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT).
   - Role-based access control to ensure only enrolled students can join specific classes.

4. **Database Schema**
   - **Class:** Details about the class.
   - **Unit:** Represents a unit of study within a class.
   - **Session:** Represents a session within a unit.
   - **Lecture:** Details of lectures within a session.
   - **Comment:** Manages comments and threaded replies.

5. **Email Notifications**
   - Use Nodemailer to send updates or notifications about classes or lectures.

### 3.3. Deployment

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Deploy the React application using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

2. **Backend Deployment**
   - Deploy using Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
   - Ensure environment variables and configurations are properly set.

## Project Management

1. **Version Control**
   - Use Git for version control, with repositories hosted on GitHub or GitLab.

2. **Testing**
   - **Frontend:** Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing React components.
   - **Backend:** Use Mocha or Jest for testing API endpoints and server-side logic.

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation for API endpoints, user guides, and developer notes.

4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI for automated testing and deployment.

## Setup Procedures

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/knowledge-land-frontend.git
   cd knowledge-land-frontend
